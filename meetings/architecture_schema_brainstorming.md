Facilitator notes:

Are there parts of the app that would benefit from things happening in the background? (tasks that take a long time or need to run on a regular basis; nightly, hourly, etc.)

Should this be one big Rails app?
How might the schema look?
Is there anything different you might need to try in your schema? (self-referential associations, serialized columns, etc.)
