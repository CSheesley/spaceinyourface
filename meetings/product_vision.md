Facilitator notes:

Make sure this session isn’t used to make decisions. That comes later. Allow everyone’s voice to be heard and make sure no one is dominating the discussion.

Encourage your team to be creative. Encourage people to share bad ideas as well as good. Sometimes bad ideas lead to good ones.

If you need questions guiding the discussion:

What would an MVP (minimum viable product) look like? If your team needed to ship features every evening to prove value to an investor, what would you work on and in what order?
What would set you apart during demo night?
What intimidates you but would be amazing to pull off?
How should your users experience the app? Desktop, mobile, native app?
What features or technology choices would spark interesting discussions during job interviews?
Would you use this product? If not, what is it missing?
Time Enforcer notes:

If debating a single idea goes longer than 5 minutes point it out. There’s no need to make a decision now and allowing one idea to dominate the discussion can hinder creativity and cause frustration.
