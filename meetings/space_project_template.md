### Space In Your Face

### Pitch
Life is busy, space is big. What awesome celestial stuff can I check out right now!

### Problem

People are eager to sky-gaze, and although there are a number of resources to for useful information, they are scattered and not easily compiled. Telescopes can be tricky to set up and use for novices.

### Solution
This application will aggregate data on the positions of celestial objects, and present it in an easily consumed format. Users will then be able know when and where to look in the sky for their desired celestial body. Future iterations will integrate this data into an automated telescope tracking program. (Hardware)

### Target Audience
Those interested in Astronomy, but who may not have the capability and training to know how to enjoy the night sky. Ideally the end product would allow even the most amateur of space fans to easily use our app, with the ability to integrate our tech into hardware installed on their telescope.

### Integrations
* Which APIs will you use?
    - TBD
    - NASA (space image of the day)
    - Open Notify (International Space Station)

* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
