#(Meeting) Prioritization - Solve

##Time Limit: 30-60 minutes

##Objective: After looking at the same problems from both product and technical perspectives you should now resolve the tension between the two.

Facilitator notes:

One way to quickly exhaust a group is to allow debates to go on too long. Have the team vote if any decision takes more than 10 minutes. If the team can’t decide bring in an instructor and they’ll be the deciding vote.

What should the schema look like?
What will your architecture look like? (background workers, caching, websockets, JavaScript)
What tasks need cards created in your project management tool? Who will add these? Label these tasks as chores. Note: migrations should be run in the context of the user stories that need them and shouldn’t have cards associated with them. An example of a chore might be is more for setting things up like Redis on Heroku.
